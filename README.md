# Penetration Testing Course by HACKTIFY

Welcome to the repository for the Penetration Testing course offered by HACKTIFY. This course covered various topics over a span of 4 weeks, providing both theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience through their labs.

## Course Overview

- Provider Name: HACKTIFY
- Course Duration: 4 weeks

## Week 1: HTML Injection and Clickjacking

In the first week, we delved into the fundamentals of HTML Injection and Clickjacking. Theoretical concepts were covered alongside practical exercises in HACKTIFY's lab environment. Each lab exercise was meticulously documented, including formal reports detailing the attacks performed.

## Week 2: IDOR and XSS

Week 2 focused on Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Similar to Week 1, we engaged in hands-on learning experiences within HACKTIFY's lab environment, followed by comprehensive documentation of our findings and exploits.

## Week 3: CSRF and SSRF

In Week 3, we expanded our knowledge by exploring Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Theoretical concepts were reinforced with practical exercises, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of these attack vectors.

## Week 4: Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges

The final week of the course was dedicated to practical application and testing of our skills through Capture The Flag challenges. We had the opportunity to work on a variety of example CTF challenges provided by HACKTIFY. Additionally, a real CTF challenge was conducted, and we documented our solutions to the challenges.
